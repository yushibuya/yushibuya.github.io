Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Here are some basic examples:

# Headers
```
# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
```

# Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
```

# Lists
## Unordered
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Item 2a
    - Item 2b
```

## Ordered
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

# Links
```
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

# Images
```
![Alt text](image.jpg)
```

# Code
```
`inline code`

```
```
block code
```
```

# Blockquotes
```
> This is a blockquote
```

# Tables
```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

These are just a few examples to get you started with Markdown.
